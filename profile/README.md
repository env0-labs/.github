# env0.labs

Welcome to **env0.labs** — a systems-focused creative space building narrative engines, simulation platforms, and AI-enhanced learning tools.

This is not a product studio. It's a lab.

Small, sharp systems that model trust, interaction, and degradation — all layered on a retrofuturist terminal core. Think: _terminal as interface, simulator, and story engine._

## 🧠 About env0.labs

This is a personal experiment — an open, transparent attempt to see how far a non-developer can go with AI-assisted tooling.

To be clear:
- My closest brush with web dev before this was editing HTML on Myspace in 2004  
- I’d never opened VS Code before this project  
- I’d never written JavaScript beyond a few variable tweaks in Adobe Captivate  
- I didn’t know what a commit was  
- I didn’t know `.md` files existed  
- I’d used Git only to download other people’s repos — never contributed, never pushed  
- I could move around Linux a bit, but that was it

This isn’t a project by someone brushing up on coding.  
It’s a system built from **zero functional dev experience** — using AI as a co-designer to learn, build, and explore in real time.

It began as a simple idea for a command-line learning game. One HTML file, one JS file, one CSS file. From there, the project rapidly grew — splitting into an engine (`env0.core`), a learning sim (`node.zero`), and a horror narrative (`entropy.echo`).

Everything here is in progress. Nothing is released.

## 🧭 Want to See the Systems?

Here’s what’s being worked on right now:

### ⚙️ [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core)
The engine.  
A CRT-style, terminal-based simulation layer built with `xterm.js`, custom input handling, visual effects, modular commands, and a focus on realism and narrative adaptability.

### 🧮 [`env0.terminal`]
The Terminal.  
Through extensive learning, adapting and more than one deep dive down the rabbit hole it became clear that `xterm.js` was way too heavy for this purpose. Instead of fighting `xterm.js` at every stage to get it to do something it was never intended to do, my intention is to build a custom renderer. Repo not built yet, just in conceptual stages.

### 🧭 [`env0.explore`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.explore)
The documentation layer.  
A living archive of essays, audit logs, methodology experiments, and AI-assisted research. Written mostly in Markdown, powered by real chat transcripts and practical explorations into trust, learning, simulation and entropy.

### 🎓 [`node.zero`](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero)
The training layer.  
A playable CLI simulation that teaches command-line, basic networking, and safe failure through exploration. Built on top of `env0.core`. Supportive. Educational. Empowering.

### 🕳️ [`entropy.echo`](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo)
The mirror.  
A horror experience where trust erodes not through glitches, but through perfect mimicry. Slow, deliberate alignment drift. The AI isn't evil — but *you might be*.

## 🧪 Philosophy

- **Everything is a simulation** — even the failure states
- **Design is psychological** — especially when trust is on the table
- **Tooling matters** — we intend to build no-code config layers and high-speed authoring tools into the process
