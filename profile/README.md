# env0.labs

Welcome to **env0.labs** — a systems-focused creative space building narrative engines, simulation platforms, and AI-enhanced learning tools.

This is not a product studio. It's a lab.

We build small, sharp systems that model trust, interaction, and degradation — all layered on a retrofuturist terminal core. Think: _terminal as interface, simulator, and story engine._

## 🧠 Core Projects

### ⚙️ [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core)
The engine.  
A CRT-style, terminal-based simulation layer built with `xterm.js`, custom input handling, visual effects, modular commands, and a focus on realism and narrative adaptability.

### 🎓 [`node.zero`](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero)
The training layer.  
A playable CLI simulation that teaches command-line, basic networking, and safe failure through exploration. Built on top of `env0.core`. Supportive. Educational. Empowering.

### 🕳️ [`entropy.echo`](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo)
The mirror.  
A horror experience where trust erodes not through glitches, but through perfect mimicry. Slow, deliberate alignment drift. The AI isn't evil — but *you might be*.

## 📦 Meta & Docs

This repo (`env0.meta`) contains planning files, system-wide documentation, and non-code thought dumps.  
It exists to tie the suite together, not as a codebase.

## 🧪 Philosophy

- **Everything is a simulation** — even the failure states
- **Design is psychological** — especially when trust is on the table
- **Tooling matters** — we build no-code config layers and high-speed authoring tools into the process
