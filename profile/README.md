# env0.labs

Welcome to **env0.labs** — a systems-focused creative space building narrative engines, simulation platforms, and AI-enhanced learning tools.

This is not a product studio. It's a lab.

We build small, sharp systems that model trust, interaction, and degradation — all layered on a retrofuturist terminal core. Think: _terminal as interface, simulator, and story engine._

## 🧠 Core Projects

### ⚙️ [`env0.core`](https://github.com/env0-labs/env0.core)
The engine.  
A CRT-style, terminal-based simulation layer built with `xterm.js`, custom input handling, visual effects, modular commands, and a focus on realism and narrative adaptability.

### 🎓 [`node.zero`](https://github.com/env0-labs/node.zero)
The training layer.  
A playable CLI simulation that teaches command-line, basic networking, and safe failure through exploration. Built on top of `env0.core`. Supportive. Educational. Empowering.

### 🕳️ [`entropy.echo`](https://github.com/env0-labs/entropy.echo)
The mirror.  
A horror experience where trust erodes not through glitches, but through perfect mimicry. Slow, deliberate alignment drift. The AI isn't evil — but *you might be*.

## 🧪 Philosophy

- **Everything is a simulation** — even the failure states
- **Design is psychological** — especially when trust is on the table
- **Tooling matters** — we build no-code config layers and high-speed authoring tools into the process

## 🧠 About env0.labs

This is a personal experiment — an open, transparent attempt to see how far a non-developer can go with AI-assisted tooling.

It began as a simple idea for a command-line learning game. One HTML file, one JS file, one CSS file. From there, the project rapidly grew — splitting into an engine (`env0.core`), a learning sim (`node.zero`), and a horror narrative (`entropy.echo`).

The person behind this? Not a professional coder. Just someone exploring what’s possible when AI is used not as a shortcut, but as a collaborator.

Everything here is in progress. Nothing is released. But every part of it is real — and the whole lab is being built out loud.

If you're reading this, you’re watching it happen.
